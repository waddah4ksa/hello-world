# GitHub Hello-World Exercise 10min Read , 20190320

You’ll learn how to:
- Create and use a repository.
- Start and manage a new branch.
- Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits.
- Open and merge a pull request.

What is GitHub?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests.
You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.

No coding necessary
To complete this tutorial, you need a <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub.com</a> account and Internet access.
You don’t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software GitHub is built on).
Tip: Open this guide in a separate browser window (or tab) so you can see it while you complete the steps in the tutorial.

Step 1. Create a Repository:
A repository is usually used to organize a single project.
Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs.
We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.
GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository.
It also offers other common options such as a license file.

Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

To create a new repository:
1. In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click  and then select New repository.
2. Name your repository hello-world.
3. Write a short description.
4. Select Initialize this repository with a README.

5. Click Create repository.
          
Step 2. Create a Branch:
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch.
We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time.
If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

This diagram shows:
The master branch
A new branch called feature (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch)
The journey that feature takes before it’s merged into master

Step 3. Make and commit changes:
Step 4. Open a Pull Request:
Step 5. Merge your Pull Request:

Celebrate!
